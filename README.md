# AlgDat2019


Source code for the algorithms and data structures course (DATS2300 / ITPE2300) at Oslo Metropolitan University.

Important: This source code is written live during a class, and may contain quite a bit of short-cuts and bad practices - It has been written to convay a single point or a single algorithm, and some other parts have therefore been sacrificed...

Most of the source code corresponds to algorithms in the [course lecture notes](https://www.cs.hioa.no/~ulfu/appolonius/index.html)

# Setup and tricks
Import this as into intellij as a VCS project from existing code.

To generate test classes, go to one of your classes (the class name), and press [alt]+[enter]. Then select "Create test", and add a Junit 5 test class. Remember to also add Junit 5.x to your classpath.
